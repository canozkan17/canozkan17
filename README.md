# 👋 Hi, I'm Can Özkan

I'm a Software Engineering Master's student based in Berlin with a strong interest in embedded systems, simulation, and real-time computing.

- 💻 I'm currently working with Python and C to build and simulate embedded systems.
- 📊 I love combining algorithmic thinking with hands-on development.
- 🛠️ I have experience in parallel computing (OpenMP, MPI), DES encryption logic, GPIO/SPI/UART protocols, and WAF simulations.
- 🎯 I'm looking for working student roles in embedded software or systems programming.

## 🔧 Projects

Here are a few highlights from my portfolio:

- [Mock Auto Brake System](https://github.com/canozkan17/Mock-Auto-Break-System): Sensor-actuator simulation of automated braking logic in Python.
- [Image Blurring via Parallel Computing](https://github.com/canozkan17/image_blurring): Implemented with Pthreads, OpenMP, and MPI in C.
- [Drone Anomaly Detection](https://github.com/canozkan17/Drone_Anomaly_Detection_via_ML): ML-based anomaly detection for drone telemetry.
- [Web Application Firewall Demo](https://github.com/canozkan17/web_application_firewall_demo_canedit): Rule-based CLI simulation of basic WAF logic.
