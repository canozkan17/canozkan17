# Hi, I'm Can Özkan 👋

Master's student in Software Engineering at University of Europe (Potsdam) - GPA 94.7/100  
Currently based in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany · Full work authorization

I’m fascinated by the point where software meets the physical world.  
A few years ago I was in a managerial position in a wind turbine component factory - that’s when I realized:  
**building something that actually exists in the real world is great, but writing code that makes it happen instantly feels god-like.**  
Embedded systems, digital twins, and real-time control sit exactly at that intersection.

Actively looking for **Werkstudent (20 h/week) or full-time junior/embedded roles** - especially in drone tech, automotive, or Industry 4.0.

### 🔧 Current main focus – Capstone Project
[![ROS2 Smart Factory Digital Twin](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=canozkan17&repo=ROS2-Based-Smart-Factory-Digital-Twin&theme=react&hide_border=true)](https://github.com/canozkan17/ROS2-Based-Smart-Factory-Digital-Twin)

Full-stack digital twin of an industrial production line using **ROS2 • MQTT • OPC UA**.  
This is where I currently spend 30-40 hours a week. Finishing end of 2025.

### 🚀 Highlighted Projects

| Project | What it is | Tech |
|-------|------------|------|
| [Mock Auto Brake System](https://github.com/canozkan17/Mock-Auto-Break-System) | Real-time ABS simulation with synthetic sensor data, automatic emergency braking, and encrypted logging (custom DES implementation) - my very first solo project | Python • Multithreading • PyQt5 • DES • SQLite |
| [Drone Anomaly Detection](https://github.com/canozkan17/Drone_Anomaly_Detection_via_ML) | 19 supervised + 5 unsupervised models on labeled drone telemetry. Random Forest won (as expected). Also proved why unsupervised approaches fail here | Scikit-learn • XGBoost • LightGBM • Pandas |
| [Image Blurring – Parallelism](https://github.com/canozkan17/image_blurring) | Sequential + OpenMP + MPI implementations in C, performance analysis of different parallelization strategies | C • OpenMP • MPI • Pthreads |

### 🎯 Areas I’m most excited about (priority order)
1. Drone tech & autonomous systems  
2. Automotive embedded (ADAS, ECU, AUTOSAR, …)  
3. Industry 4.0 / IIoT / Smart Factory  
4. Real-time & low-level systems programming
